# Seagrass Threshold Responses to Nutrients and OA

Investigating seagrass threshold responses to co-occurring nutrient enrichment and ocean acidification


### For TAC meeting

#### Mortality/Survivorship

Evaluate _Thalassia_ survivorship
[x] At 2 wks (end of acclim. period)
[x] At 6 wks (end of exp. period)
[x] At 9 wks (end of recovery period)
[x] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
[x] Differences between treatments at 9 wks

Evaluate _Halodule_ survivorship
[x] At 2 wks (end of acclim. period)
[x] At 6 wks (end of exp. period)
[x] At 9 wks (end of recovery period)
[x] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
[x] Differences between treatments at 9 wks


To evaluate survivorship (for each species individually): 
1. Find all plant IDs that still had living seagrass at end of acclim. period (wk2)
2. At 6 wks and 9 wks, calculate the proportion of those plant IDs that still had living seagrass
   a. For survivorship at 9 wks, need to account for the plants that were harvested for genetic analysis at 6 wks (n=38 plants; 19 Ambient and 19 OA). 
      These plants are missing at 9 wks, but this is not mortality due to the experiment. Calculate survivor proportion based on the number of plants 
      that were alive at 2 wks minus those plants that were harvested at 6 wks.


### Morphometry

Evaluate _Thalassia_
[x] Calculate mean leaf length for each plant at each time point 
[x] Calculate Thalassia total leaf area (one-sided leaf surface area) for each plant
[x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point (blade length, blade width, blade area)
[ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
[ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks


Evaluate _Halodule_ leaf length
[x] Calculate mean leaf length for each plant at each time point 
[x] Calculate Halodule leaf area (one-sided leaf surface area) for each plant (will need to combine with BPS counts)
[x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point (blade length, blade width, blade area)
[ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
[ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks


For leaf length: only using plant IDs with living seagrass at the time point of interest (mortality not taken into account) (i.e., just using 'morphometry' df)


### Blade structure

[ ] Thalassia blades-per-shoot
[ ] Halodule number of shoots
[ ] Halodule total number of blades
[ ] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point for both Tt and Hw
[ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks for both Tt and Hw
[ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks for both Tt and Hw


### Epiphytes

[ ] Thalassia epiphyte load (relate epiphyte mass to a structural parameter (e.g., leaf length, blade area, or shoot biomass))
[ ] Halodule epiphyte load (relate epiphyte mass to a structural parameter (e.g., leaf length, blade area, or shoot biomass))
[ ] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point for both Tt and Hw
[ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks for both Tt and Hw
[ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks for both Tt and Hw
