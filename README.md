# Seagrass Threshold Responses to Nutrients and OA

Investigating seagrass threshold responses to co-occurring nutrient enrichment and ocean acidification


## For TAC meeting

### Mortality/Survivorship

Evaluate _Thalassia_ survivorship
- [x] At 2 wks (end of acclim. period)
- [x] At 6 wks (end of exp. period)
- [x] At 9 wks (end of recovery period)
- [x] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
- [x] Differences between treatments at 9 wks

Evaluate _Halodule_ survivorship
- [x] At 2 wks (end of acclim. period)
- [x] At 6 wks (end of exp. period)
- [x] At 9 wks (end of recovery period)
- [x] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
- [x] Differences between treatments at 9 wks


To evaluate survivorship (for each species individually): 
1. Find all plant IDs that still had living seagrass at end of acclim. period (wk2)
2. At 6 wks and 9 wks, calculate the proportion of those plant IDs that still had living seagrass
   a. For survivorship at 9 wks, need to account for the plants that were harvested for genetic analysis at 6 wks (n=38 plants; 19 Ambient and 19 OA). 
      These plants are missing at 9 wks, but this is not mortality due to the experiment. Calculate survivor proportion based on the number of plants 
      that were alive at 2 wks minus those plants that were harvested at 6 wks.


### Morphometry

For leaf length: only using plant IDs with living seagrass at the time point of interest (mortality not taken into account) (i.e., just using 'morphometry' df)

Evaluate _Thalassia_
- [x] Calculate mean leaf length for each plant at each time point 
- [x] Calculate Thalassia total leaf area (one-sided leaf surface area) for each plant
- [x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point (blade length, blade width, blade area)
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks


Evaluate _Halodule_ 
- [x] Calculate mean leaf length for each plant at each time point 
- [x] Calculate Halodule leaf area (one-sided leaf surface area) for each plant (will need to combine with BPS counts)
- [x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point (blade length, blade width, blade area)
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks


### Blade structure

Number of shoots, and blades-per-shoot, come from the 'leaf and shoot counts' dataset (counted on more plants than from the morph dataset)

- [x] Thalassia number of shoots
- [x] Thalassia total number of blades
- [x] Thalassia blades-per-shoot
- [x] Halodule blades-per-shoot
- [x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point for both Tt and Hw
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks for both Tt and Hw
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks for both Tt and Hw


### Epiphytes

- [x] Thalassia epiphyte load (relate epiphyte mass to a structural parameter (e.g., leaf length, blade area, or shoot biomass))
- [x] Halodule epiphyte load (relate epiphyte mass to a structural parameter (e.g., leaf length, blade area, or shoot biomass))
- [ ] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point for both Tt and Hw
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 6 wks for both Tt and Hw
- [ ] Differences between treatments at 9 wks for both Tt and Hw


### Shoot Biomass (from genetic samples)

- [x] Thalassia shoot biomass
- [x] Halodule shoot biomass
- [x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point for both Tt and Hw


### Porewater

- [ ] Calculate H2S concentration from sulfide and pH values
- [x] Calculate treatment means (and SE) at each time point for sulfide, H2S, and pH


### Exploratory Figures

- [ ] Survivorship curves for both species
   - [ ] Over time, w/ lines for each treatment
   - [x] Comparing treatments, w/ lines for wk 6 and wk 9
- [ ] Morphometry (blade length) over time for both species
   - [ ] Can get some wk 0 data/info from the 'meadow' datasets (leaf morph, leaf biomass)
- [ ] Shoot structure (total number of leaves) over time for both species
- [x] Morphometry between treatments at experiment end (wk 9) for both species
   - [x] Blade length
   - [x] Blade area
   - [x] Total leaf surface area
- [ ] Blade structure over time for both species
- [x] Blade structure between treatments at experiment end (wk 9) for both species
   - [x] Number of shoots
   - [x] Number of blades
   - [x] Blades-per-shoot
- [x] Shoot biomass between treatments at experiment end (wk 9) for both species
- [x] Epiphyte load at wk 9 for both species
- [ ] pH
   - [ ] pH time-series in tables
   - [x] Comparing porewater pH between treatments at wks 2, 6, and 9
- [ ] Porewater sulfide
   - [ ] Sulfide over time, w/ lines for each treatment
   - [x] Comparing total sulfide between treatments at wks 2, 6, and 9


(Maybe box-and-whisker plots, with jittered points, rather than mean+SE for figures?)
